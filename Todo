Here are four tasks covering the primary data types:

### 1. The List & Tuple Challenge: "The Secure Sorter"

**Goal:** Practice the difference between mutable (Lists) and immutable (Tuples) structures.

* **Task:** Create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score (e.g., `[("Alice", 85), ("Bob", 75)]`).
* **Requirement:** 1. Sort the list based on the scores in descending order.
2. Attempt to change a score inside one of the tuples and observe the error.
3. Then, "update" a score by replacing the entire tuple at that index.

### 2. The Dictionary Task: "Word Frequency Counter"

**Goal:** Master key-value mapping and dictionary methods.

* **Task:** Take a long string (like the 4-line poem you used earlier).
* **Requirement:** Create a dictionary where the **keys** are unique words from the string and the **values** are the number of times that word appears.
* **Hint:** Use the `.split()` method to turn your string into a list of words first.

### 3. The Set Task: "Guest List Cleaner"

**Goal:** Understand how **Sets** handle unique values and comparisons.

* **Task:** You have two lists of email addresses, `list_a` and `list_b`. Some emails are in both lists.
* **Requirement:** 1. Create a single collection that contains only **unique** emails from both lists combined.
2. Find only the emails that appear in **both** lists (the intersection).

### 4. The Dictionary + List Combo: "Inventory Manager"

**Goal:** Practice "Nested Data Structures" (placing one data type inside another).

* **Task:** Create a dictionary called `inventory`. The **keys** should be category names (e.g., "Fruit", "Vegetables"). The **values** should be **lists** of items in that category.
* **Requirement:** 1. Write a line of code to add a new item to the "Fruit" list.
2. Write a loop that prints each category name and how many items are in it (using `len()`).
